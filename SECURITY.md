### Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this MLOps infrastructure project, please report it responsibly.

#### How to Report

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security concerns to: [your-email@example.com]
3. **Include** the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

#### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
- **Fix**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timeline
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

When using this MLOps infrastructure:

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use Kubernetes Secrets or external secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least privilege access principles

#### Network Security
- Implement proper network policies
- Use TLS/SSL for all communications
- Restrict access to management interfaces
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

#### Container Security
- Use minimal base images
- Regularly update container images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use non-root users when possible

#### Kubernetes Security
- Enable RBAC and use least privilege
- Use Pod Security Standards
- Regular security audits
- Keep Kubernetes updated

#### Access Control
- Use strong authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper authorization
- Regular access reviews
- Monitor access patterns

### Security Scanning

This project includes automated security scanning:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Scan container images for security issues
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Validate security configurations
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues

### Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Isolate** affected systems
2. **Assess** the scope and impact
3. **Contain** the incident
4. **Eradicate** the threat
5. **Recover** systems safely
6. **Document** lessons learned

### Compliance

This project aims to follow security best practices and can be configured to meet various compliance requirements:

- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Controls

### Regular Security Reviews

We conduct regular security reviews including:

- Code reviews with security focus
- Infrastructure security assessments
- Dependency vulnerability assessments
- Penetration testing (when appropriate)
