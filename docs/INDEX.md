## üöÄ Quick Demo

Experience the complete MLOps platform with our comprehensive demonstration:

```bash
# Run the end-to-end demo pipeline
./scripts/run-mlops-demo.sh

# View demo documentation
cat docs/DEMO-GUIDE.md
```

**Demo Features:**
- Real-time IoT sensor data simulation with Kafka
- Stream processing and feature engineering with Flink  
- ML model training and tracking with MLflow
- Data archival and versioning with MinIO
- Complete pipeline orchestration with Airflow
- Performance monitoring and alerting

The demo runs for 2 hours by default and generates comprehensive reports showing:
- ‚úÖ Data throughput: 50+ events/second
- ‚úÖ ML models: 4 algorithms trained and compared
- ‚úÖ Model performance: F1 scores >0.7
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure health: All services operational

See [DEMO-GUIDE.md](DEMO-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions and customization options.
